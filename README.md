# CS440
Homeworks for CS440 (Artificial Intelligence) at WSU, taught by Larry Holder during Fall 2014.

For this course we were asked to implement an intelligent agent to play the Wumpus game. All code is done in C++ and was tested under Windows, but should function the same under Linux. No guarentees that any of the homeworks will always perfectly solve (or solve in general) the game.

The agent gets progressively more advanced for each of the homeworks. The Wumpus folder contains a base version of the Wumpus game, provided by the professor.
